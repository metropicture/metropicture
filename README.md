# Metropicture

The Metropicture operating system codebase.

## Status

The 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 branches are particular beginner starts at what the codebase would be like. It turns out building the operating system from scratch is not worthy; therefore I am going to fork an existing desktop environment regardless of what I will have to maintain.

I am going to fork Linux Mint since it is performant.
